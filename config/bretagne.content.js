Throw a small rock in the sea.
Ripples appears at the surface, shaped by the seabed as they spread.
Bretagne is a matter of surface and deepness,
a matter of traces left by primitive forces:
wrinkles carved in manâ€™s foreheads by old legends,
furrows digging the dune under the west wind
and the great swell rising up on the shallows.
